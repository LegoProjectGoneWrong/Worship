.Album: Come Worship: 25 Vineyard Worship Songs
[V1]
 I'm giving You my heart, all that is within
 I lay it all down, for the sake of You my King
 I'm giving You my dreams, laying down my rights
 I'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new life*
.
[C1]
 And I surrender all to You, all to You
 And I surrender all to You, all to You
[V2]
 I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross
 And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss
 For the sake of knowing You, for the glory of Your name
 To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain
