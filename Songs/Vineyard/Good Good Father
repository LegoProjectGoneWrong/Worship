  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G  C  Cadd2   (2x)
[V1]
.G              C      Cadd2
 Oh, I've heard a thousand stories 
.G              C          Cadd2
 Of what they think You're like
.G                     C     Cadd2
 But, I've heard the tender whisper 
.G               C      Cadd2
 Of love in the dead of night
.C      G/B
 And You tell me that You're pleased
.Am7         D - Dsus4 - D
 And that I'm never alone
.
[C]
.Cadd2
 You're a Good, Good Father
.G/B
 It's who You are 
.Am7
 It's who You are
.D
 It's who you are
.Cadd2
 And I'm loved by You
.G/B
 It's who I am
.Am7
 It's who I am
.D – Dsus4 - D
 It's who I am
.
[V2]
 Oh, and I've seen many searching 
 For answers far and wide
 But I know we're all searching
 For answers only You provide
 ‘Cause You know just what we need
 Before we, say a word
.
[B]
.Cadd2                  Em
 ‘Cause You are perfect 
       in all of your ways
.Am                      G
 Perfect in all of your ways
.Cadd2                  Em     D
 You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
.
[V31]
 Oh, it’s a love so un-deniable
 I, I can hardly speak
 Peace so un-explainable
 I, I can hardly think
[V32]
 As You call me deeper still
 As You call me deeper still
 As You call me deeper still
 And to love, love, love
.[INSTRUMENTAL ENDING]
.Cadd2  G/B  Am7  D  Cadd2
