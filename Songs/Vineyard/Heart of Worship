  <lyrics>[V1]
.  D              A                     Em                A7sus4
 When the music fades, all is stripped away, and I simply come;
.  D               A                          Em
 Longing just to bring, something that's of worth
.                     A7sus4
 That will bless your heart.
.     Em           D/F#      A
 I'll bring you more than a song,
.                 Em            D/F#               A    A/C#   D
 For a song in itself is not what You have required
.   Em            D/F#       A
 You search much deeper within
.                           Em
 Through the way things appear;
.                 D/F#       A
 You're looking into my heart
.
[C1]
.  D                           A2/C#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.               Em        G             A       D
 And it's all about You, its all about You, Jesus
.    D                        A2/C#
 I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it,
.           Em              G        A      D
 When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus
.
[V2]
.  D               A                       Em                A7sus4
 King of endless worth, no one could express, how much You deserve;
.  D                 A                    Em                   A7sus4
 Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath
.    Em           D/F#        A
 I'll bring you more than a song.
.                Em              D/F#             A   A/C#    D
 For a song in itself is not what You have required
.  Em              D/F#      A
 You search much deeper within
.                            Em
 Through the way things appear;
.                 D/F#       A
 You're looking into my heart

[C2]
.  D                           A2/C#
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship
.               Em        G             A       D
 And it's all about You, its all about You, Jesus
.    D                        A2/C#
 I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it,
.           Em              G        A      D
 When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus
