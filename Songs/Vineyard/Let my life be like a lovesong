  <title>Let my life be like a lovesong</title>
  <lyrics>[C]
 (So) Let my life be like a love song
 Let my life be like a love song
 Let my life be like a love song
 To Your heart
.
.
[V1]
 Lord the love You give You give so gen'rously
 You were my sacrifice You gave Your life for me
 And now I want to give just as I've received
 To live a life that shines Your love
 For those in need
.
.
[V2]
 So let justice roll like an endless stream
 Flowing through my life to the poor and weak
 Let the things I do and words I speak
 Reveal the awesome love You have shown to me</lyrics>
