  <title>No Longer Slaves</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.G
 You unravel me, with a melody
.C          D      G
 You surround me with a song
.G
 Of deliverance, from my enemies    
.C          D         G
 Till all my fears are gone
.
[C]
.C           D        G
 I’m no longer a slave to fear
.Em     D        G
 I am a child of God
.
[V2]
 From my Mother’s womb   
 You have chosen me
 Love has called my name                            
 I’ve been born again, into your family
 Your blood flows through my veins 
.
[V3]
 I am surrounded by the arms of the Father
 I am surrounded by songs of deliverance
 We've been liberated from our bondage
 We're the sons and the daughters
 Let us our sing our freedom
.
.[Interlude]
.Em   D    G    C
.Ohhh, Ohhh...
.
[B]
.Em            D              G           C
 You split the sea so I could walk right through it
.Em            D              G           C
 My fears are drowned in perfect love
.Em          D             G          Em
 You rescued me and I will stand and sing
.C       D       G 
 I am a child of God
.
[Outro]
.C       D       G
 I am a child of God
