  <lyrics>[V1]
.D            A                Em                 D       A           G
 Light of the world you stepped out into darkness open my eyes let me see
.D           A         Em              D          A             G
 Beauty that made this heart adore you hope of a life spent with you
.
[C1]
.G            D                    A                     D              G
 Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that your my God 
.G                  D                A                  D           G
 You're altogether lovely altogether worthy altogether wonderful to me

 King of all days o so highly exalted Glorious in Heaven above Humbly you came 
.       Em                D            A          G
 to the earth you created all for love sake became poor
.

 Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that your my God 
.G                  D                A                  D           G

.A          D             G         A      D         G

.A          D             G         A      D         G
 I'll never know how much it costs to see my sin upon that cross
