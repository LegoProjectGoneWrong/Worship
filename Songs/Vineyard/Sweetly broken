.CAPO 2
.Introduction: D A Bm G

[V1}
.D A
 To the cross I look, to the cross I cling
.Bm G
 Of its suffering I do drink, of its work I do sing
.D A
 For on it my Saviour, both bruised and crushed
.Bm G
 Showed that God is love and God is just
[C1]
.D
 At the cross You beckon me
.Bm
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
.A
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m
.G
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered
[V2]
.D A
 What a priceless gift, undeserved life
.Bm G
 Have I been given through Christ crucified
.D A
 You’ve called me out of death, You’ve called me into life
.Bm G
 And I was under Your wrath, now through the cross I’m reconciled
[C2]
.D
 At the cross You beckon me
.Bm
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
.A
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I’m
.G
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered
[B]
.Em G
 In Awe of the cross I must confess
.Em G A
 How wonderous Your redeeming love and how great is Your faithfulness</lyrics>
