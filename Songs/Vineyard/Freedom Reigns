  <lyrics>[V1]
.         D
 Where the spirit of the Lord is
.          Bm
 There is freedom
.          A
 Where the spirit of the Lord is
.          G
 There is freedom
[V2]
 Lift Your eyes to heaven
 There is freedom
 Lift Your eyes to heaven
 There is freedom
[C]
 Freedom reigns in this place
 Showers of mercy and grace
 Falling on every face
 There is freedom
[V3]
 If You're tired and thirsty
 There is freedom
 If You're tired and thirsty
 There is freedom
[V4]
 Give Your all to Jesus
 Give him all, there is freedom
 Give Your all to Jesus
 There is freedom
[V5]
 If your burden's heavy
 He brings freedom
 If your burden's heavy
 He brings freedom
[V6]
 If you're hurt and broken
 He brings freedom
 If you're hurt and broken
 He brings freedom
