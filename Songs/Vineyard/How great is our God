  <lyrics>. G     Em     C     D
.
[V1]
 The splendor of a king
 Clothed in majesty
 Let all the earth rejoice
 All the earth rejoice
 He wraps Himself in light,
 And darkness tries to hide
 And trembles at His voice
 Trembles at His voice
.
[C1]
 How great is our God – sing with me
 How great is our God – and all will see
 How great, how great is our God
.
[V2]
 Age to age He stands
 And time is in His hands
 Beginning and the end
 Beginning and the end
 The Godhead Three in One
 Father, Spirit and Son
 Lion and the Lamb
 Lion and the Lamb
.
[C2]
 How great is our God – sing with me
 How great is our God – and all will see
 How great, how great is our God
[B]
 Name above all names
 Worthy of all praise
 My heart will sing
 How great is our God
.
[C3]
 How great is our God – sing with me
 How great is our God – and all will see
 How great, how great is our God
