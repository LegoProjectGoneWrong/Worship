  <title>Lord Reign in Me</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
 Over all the earth,
 You reign on high,
 Every mountain stream,
 Every sunset sky,
 But my one request,
 Lord my only aim,
 Is that you'd reign in me again,
[C]
 Lord reign in me,
 Reign in your power.
 Over all my dreams,
 In my darkest hour.
 You are the Lord
 Of all I am,
 So won't you reign in me again?
[V2]
 Over every thought,
 Over every word,
 May my life reflect
 The beauty of my Lord 
 Cause you mean more to me
 than any earthly thing,
 So won't you reign in me again?
