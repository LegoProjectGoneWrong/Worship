  <lyrics>[V1]
.G        D                    Em            C
 Blessed be You name  in the land that is plenitful
.          G          D               C
 Where Your streams of abundance flow  Blessed be Your name
.G            D                       Em           C
 And blessed be Your name  when I'm found in the desert place
.         G                 D           C
 Though I walk through the wilderness  Blessed be Your name

[Pre]
.G                     D               Em             C
 Every blessing You pour out I'll  turn back to praise 
.G                     D               Em             C
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord  Still I will say
[C]            
.                  G           D 
   Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                   Em       C
   Blessed be Your name
.                  G           D
   Blessed be Your name of the Lord
.                   Em       C
   Blessed be Your glorious name

[V2]
.G        D                      Em            C  
 Blessed be Your name  when the sun's shining down on me
.         G               D              C 
 When the world's "all as it should be"  Blessed be Your name
.G            D                    Em               C
 And blessed be Your name  on the road marked with suffering 
.               G           D         C
 Though there's pain in the offering  Blessed be Your name
.
[B]
.    G              D
 You give and take away
.    Em             C
 You give and take away
.    G                   D
 My heart will choose to say
.      Em               C
 Lord, blessed be Your name</lyrics>
