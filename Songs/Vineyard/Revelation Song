[V1]
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is He.
 Sing a new song to Him who sits on Heaven's Mercy Seat.
.
[C]
 Holy, Holy, Holy is The Lord, God Almighty. 
 Who was and is and is to come.
 With all creation I sing, "Praise to The King of Kings,
 You are my everything. And I will adore You"
.
[V2]
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color. 
 Flashes of lightening, rolls of thunder.
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be,
 To You, the only wise King.
.
[C2]
 Holy, Holy, Holy is The Lord, God Almighty. 
 Who was and is and is to come.
 With all creation I sing, "Praise to The King of Kings,
 You are my everything. And I will adore You"
.
[V3]
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder,
 At the mention of Your Name.
 Jesus, Your Name is power, breath and living water.
 Such a marvelous mystery.
